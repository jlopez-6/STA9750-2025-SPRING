I’ve worked extensively with seismic data, programming, and quantitative research, and I’m currently expanding my expertise through an MS in Statistics at Baruch College.\nAt Lamont, I work on modernizing analog seismic data and investigating atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions. You can find my publications on ORCID.\nAs a Catholic, my faith guides my approach to learning, discovery, and service. I strive to bring truth, integrity, and purpose to everything I do.\nHere’s my resume. Explore my work, and let’s connect!\n\nLast updated: Saturday February 08, 2025 at 10:55 PM"
