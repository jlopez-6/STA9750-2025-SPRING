    "text": "1.1 Executive Summary\nThis report analyzes New York City personnel expenditure data collected between 2014 and 2024, with the goal of analyzing policies that effectively reduce personnel spending. The Commission proposes 3 policy options:\n\nPolicy I: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level\nPolicy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nPolicy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\n\nThe data suggest that Policy II offers the largest amount of savings, although its implementation will be significantly difficult. Policy I would result in the least savings, but is the easiest to implement. Policy III strikes a balance between the two, offering moderate savings and ease of implementation.\nThe Commission most strongly recommends that the City implement Policy III, where raises for high earners are tied to demonstrated productivity improvements, ensuring sustainable wage growth.\n\n1.1.1 Quick Facts\n\nThe job title with the highest base rate of pay is Chairman with a rate of $567 per hour.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nnyc_payroll &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mp01/nyc_payroll_export.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(agency_name = str_to_title(agency_name),\n         last_name = str_to_title(last_name),\n         first_name = str_to_title(first_name),\n         work_location_borough = str_to_title(work_location_borough),\n         title_description = str_to_title(title_description),\n         leave_status_as_of_june_30 = str_to_title(leave_status_as_of_june_30))\n\n# Constants\nWORK_HOURS_IN_DAY = 7.5\nFT_ANNUAL_HOURS = 2000\nN_ITEMS = 20\nPAY_RAISE_CAP = 0.005\n\nHOURLY_RATE_MAX = nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  filter(pay_basis == \"per Hour\") |&gt;\n  arrange(base_salary) |&gt;\n  mutate(jump = base_salary - lag(base_salary)) |&gt;\n  select(jump, base_salary, agency_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(jump) |&gt;\n  slice_max(jump,n=1) |&gt;\n  pull(base_salary)\n\n# Adding total_pay and base_rt_hr columns.\nnyc_payroll &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  mutate(total_pay =\n           case_when(\n             (pay_basis == \"per Day\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &lt; 0) ~ base_salary * floor(regular_hours / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Day\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &gt;= 0) ~ base_salary * floor(regular_hours / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) + ((base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) * ot_hours * 1.5),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &gt;= 0) ~ base_salary * (regular_hours + ot_hours * 1.5),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &lt; 0) ~ base_salary * regular_hours,\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &lt; 0) ~ NA,\n             .default = base_salary + (base_salary/FT_ANNUAL_HOURS * 1.5 * ot_hours),\n             ),\n         base_rate_hr = case_when(\n           pay_basis == \"per Day\" & (base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) &lt; HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY,\n           pay_basis == \"per Day\" & (base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) &gt;= HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, # I assume they meant pay basis is per Annum\n           pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & base_salary &lt; HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary,\n           pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & base_salary &gt;= HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, # I assume they meant per Annum\n           TRUE ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS\n      )\n    )\n\nhighest_base_rate &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year,\n         last_name,mid_init,first_name,\n         title_description,\n         agency_name,\n         base_rate_hr) |&gt;\n  slice_max(base_rate_hr, n=1)\n\n\n\nThe individual with the single highest city total payroll was Chief Fire Marshal at the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), Daniel E.

It follows then, that a large portion of the City’s budget is dedicated to personnel costs.

However, in 2025, the city government estimates that it will see an 3.8% increase in personnel spending. Likewise, the City predicts that 2026 will see a 2.6% rise in salaries, even though total expenditures will be down 1.1% that year. Indeed, rising personnel costs is and will continue to be a pervasive problem for New York City, with the Comptroller estimating a 3.4% annual growth in payroll expenditure for 2026 and beyond (Figure 1) (Comptroller, 2024).\n\nCode\nlast_yr = tail(actual_payroll,n=1) |&gt; pull(fiscal_year)\nlast_ap = tail(actual_payroll,n=1) |&gt; pull(aggregate_pay)\n\npredicted_payroll &lt;- tibble(\n  fiscal_year = c(last_yr,2025, 2026, 2027, 2028),  \n  aggregate_pay = c(last_ap,last_ap*1.038, last_ap*1.038*1.026, last_ap*1.038*1.026*1.038, last_ap*1.038*1.026*(1.038^2)) \n)\n\ncombined_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  predicted_payroll |&gt; mutate(type = \"Predicted\"),\n  actual_payroll |&gt; mutate(type = \"Actual\")\n)|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fiscal_year, y = aggregate_pay, color = type, linetype = type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +  \n  geom_point(size = 3) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Actual\" = \"#78c2ad\", \"Predicted\" = \"gray80\")) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"NYC Payroll Expenditure\",\n    x = \"Fiscal Year\",\n    y = \"Aggregate Payroll ($)\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Payroll Expenditure per Year\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nTo address this problem, Mayor Eric L.

The Commission notes that superficial changes were made to several text columns in the dataframe to prepare them for presentation. Furthermore, the Commission creates two new columns:\n\ntotal_pay\nbase_rate_hr\n\nThe total_pay column contains the total gross pay of each employee based on their base pay, their pay basis (per Hour, per Day, or assumed annual salary), and the number of hours–both regular and OT–reported. Several cases in the data set contained negative counts for hours. The Commision addressed this by setting total_pay to NA for these cases. The base_rate_hr column represents an employee’s estimated hourly wage, calculated based on their pay basis, while ensuring reasonable hourly rate assumptions of less than $67,440 per hour. This assumption was developed to address pay basis and base salary mismatch errors."

    "text": "1.5 Policy Analysis\nThe Commission proposes the following policies to address mounting payroll expenditures.\n\n1.5.1 Policy I: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level\nOne approach to reducing personnel expenditures is to cap the salaries of subordinate employees, so that the mayor of the City earns the highest salary. Table 2 presents the salaries of New York City’s Mayor from 2014 to 2024.\n\nTable 2: Salaries of New York City’s Mayor (2014-2024)\n\n\nCode\nmayor_pay &lt;- nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(title_description == \"Mayor\" &\n           leave_status_as_of_june_30 == \"Active\") |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year, mayoral_cap = total_pay)\n\nkable(mayor_pay, col.names = c(\"Fiscal Year\", \"Mayoral Cap ($)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\nMayoral Cap ($)\n\n\n\n\n2024\n258750\n\n\n2023\n258750\n\n\n2022\n258750\n\n\n2021\n258750\n\n\n2020\n258750\n\n\n2019\n258750\n\n\n2018\n258750\n\n\n2017\n225000\n\n\n2016\n225000\n\n\n2015\n225000\n\n\n2014\n225000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, 1,566 job titles earned more money than the mayor did during the the same fiscal year. A distribution of the agencies with employees exceeding the mayoral salary is shown in figure 2. The vast majority of people who earned more money than the mayor work for the Department of Corrections. This is followed by the FDNY and the NYPD. These agencies would see the largest savings if personnel salaries are capped at the mayoral level.\n\nCode\nexceeding_agencies &lt;- nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  filter(total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year, last_name, mid_init, first_name, agency_name, title_description, total_pay) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n())\n\nremaining_agency_count &lt;- max(nrow(exceeding_agencies) - N_ITEMS, 0)\n\nremaining_sum &lt;- exceeding_agencies |&gt; \n  slice_min(n, n = remaining_agency_count) |&gt; \n  summarize(sum_n = sum(n)) |&gt; \n  pull(sum_n)\n\nremaining_agency_count\n\n\nCode\nremaining_sum\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exceeding_agencies |&gt; slice_max(n, n=N_ITEMS), aes(x = reorder(agency_name, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies Exceeding Mayoral Cap\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Number of Entries Exceeding Cap \\n(FY2014-FY2024)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of Employees in Agencies Exceeding Mayoral Cap\n\n\n[1] 47\n\n\n[1] 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nThe Commission identifies agency title groupings that have significant numbers of payroll entries over the mayoral cap. These are presented in table 3. The top two rows suggest that Captains at the Department of Corrections and the Fire Department would be most affected by this policy.\n\nTable 3: Agency-Title Pairs Exceeding Mayoral Cap\n\n\nCode\nagency_titles_over_mayoral_cap &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(is_over_cap = total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n(), n_over = sum(is_over_cap, na.rm = TRUE), freq = mean(is_over_cap, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nagency_titles_over_mayoral_cap |&gt;\n  filter(n_over &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  select(agency_name,title_description,n_over) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n_over)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Title Description\" = title_description,\n         \"Entries Over Mayoral Cap\" = n_over) |&gt;\n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total savings per fiscal year that could have resulted from enactment of the proposed policy are presented in table 4. The Commission notes that, had the proposed policy been enacted in 2014, New York City would have seen total savings of $39,074,243.\n\nTable 4: Savings per Annum from Policy I\n\n\nCode\n# Determine total savings if these employees’ compensation were capped at the mayor’s salary.\nsavings_per_year &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  filter(total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = total_pay - mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  group_by(fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings,na.rm=TRUE),0), n_over = n())\n\ntotal_savings &lt;- savings_per_year |&gt; summarize(sum(total_savings, na.rm=TRUE))\n\ndatatable(savings_per_year |&gt;\n            rename(\"Fiscal Year\" = fiscal_year,\n                   \"# of Entries Exceeding Mayoral Cap\" = n_over,\n                   \"Savings ($)\" = total_savings))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission does not recommend a blanket capping subordinate salaries at the mayoral level. A majority of employees earning more than the mayor hold positions that involve significant risks. Given the nature of these high-risk jobs, the Commission believes that these employees should be fairly compensated for the additional responsibilities and dangers they face in their roles. However, the Commission is not against capping salaries on a title-by-title basis.\n\n\n1.5.2 Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nA second approach to curtailing personnel expenditure is increasing staffing to reduce OT expenses. For this analysis, the Commission assumes that a full-time position is 2000 hours a year. Figure 3 presents OT hours converted to the number of new full-time employees required to fulfill the same amount of work hours. The total number of new employees needed to address the current OT load is 200,412. This represents the workforce that would need to be hired if OT hours were eliminated through additional staffing. The Commission notes that this number is approximately 50% of the last fiscal year’s workforce 1.\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_ot = sum(ot_hours), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(n_fte_yearly = total_ot / 2000) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_n_fte = sum(n_fte_yearly, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_n_fte)) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_n_fte, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  # Show top 20 only\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(paste(agency_name, title_description, sep=\" | \"), total_n_fte), y = total_n_fte)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"OT Hours Converted to FTE\",\n    x = \"Agency | Job Title\",\n    y = \"Number of Full-Time Equivalent Positions\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Full Time Personnel Equivalent, by Agency and Title \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nThe total potential savings from this proposed policy amount to $15,025,441,508 (Table 5). The commission notes that the potential savings from this policy are almost 400x that of Policy I.\nEnacting this policy entails recruiting:\n\nover 30,000 police officers,\nover 20,000 firefighters,\nand over 15,000 corrections officers.\n\nThese positions are difficult to fill, as they are high-risk in nature and require specialized training. Therefore, the Commission recommends a more feasible, scaled-down version of this policy. Under this modified approach, the City would subsidize the training costs for these critical positions, and the recruitment rate would be regularly assessed to ensure that sufficient progress is being made in filling these roles.\nTable 5 presents total savings by agency.\n\nTable 5: Total Savings by Agency\n\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = base_rate_hr * ot_hours) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings, na.rm=TRUE),0)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Total Savings ($)\" = total_savings) |&gt;\n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Policy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\nThe third policy the Commission proposes to reduce personnel spending is the reduction of salary increases for the top 10% of earners in their respective agencies to 1.05% of their base hourly rate.

The highest average increase is $7.70 at Brooklyn Community Board 12. The Commission also notes the appearance of 11 community boards within the top 20 agencies (Figure 5).\n\nCode\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt; \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_rate_increase_per_person != Inf, avg_rate_increase_per_person != -Inf ) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_rate_increase_per_agency = mean(avg_rate_increase_per_person, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data |&gt;\n  slice_max(avg_rate_increase_per_agency, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, avg_rate_increase_per_agency), y = avg_rate_increase_per_agency)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies by Mean Pay Raise Amount\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Mean Pay Raise Amount ($/hr)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Increase in Hourly Rate per Agency\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay raise amount per agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nCombining these two metrics, we get an estimate of the amount spent per agency on high-earner raises over the last 10 fiscal years. The Department of Education far outranks all other agencies with an expenditure of almost $500 million (Figure 6). They are followed by the Police Department at just over $200 million. Over the last 10 years, the total amount spent by the City on pay raises for high earners was about $1.9 billion.\n\nCode\ntotal_raise_spending &lt;- \n  avg_pay_raise_rate_data |&gt; \n  inner_join(avg_rate_increase_per_agency_data, join_by(agency_name == agency_name)) |&gt;  \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_raise_spend_per_year = sum(n_raises_per_agency * avg_pay_raise_rate * avg_rate_increase_per_agency * 2000, na.rm=TRUE)) \n  \ntotal_raise_spending |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_raise_spend_per_year,n=20) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, total_raise_spend_per_year), y = total_raise_spend_per_year)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies by Amount Spent on Pay Raises for High Earners\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Dollars\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Agencies Spending the Most on Raises for High-Earners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nThe Commission estimates that, if high-earner raises had been capped at 0.05% in 2014, total savings by the City are approximately $976 million. Such a policy could have slashed 10-year-expenditure by up to 50%. The following analysis demonstrates the potential savings:\n\n\nCode\nsavings_from_capping &lt;- \n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt; 1, base_rate_change &gt; 0, excess_raise &gt; 0, excess_raise != Inf) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n    total_savings = sum(excess_raise * FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, na.rm=TRUE),  # Assume full-time work hours\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(total_savings, n=1)\n\n\nBased on these findings, the Commission recommends adopting a measured approach to this policy. High earners should be permitted to receive higher compensation if it is justified by demonstrable productivity improvements. This ensures that wage growth is tied to measurable value.\n\n\n1.6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Commission’s report highlights the potential benefits of the implementation of three policies: capping salaries at the mayoral level, increasing staffing to reduce overtime, and reducing salary increases for top earners. Given the fiscal challenges facing New York City, and the Commission’s analysis of New York City’s personnel expenditure data, we most strongly support the adoption of Policy III. This option offers reasonable savings and is easy to implement."

However, the Commission is not against capping salaries on a title-by-title basis."

The Commission notes that this number is approximately 50% of the last fiscal year’s workforce 2.\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_ot = sum(ot_hours), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(n_fte_yearly = total_ot / 2000) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_n_fte = sum(n_fte_yearly, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_n_fte)) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_n_fte, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  # Show top 20 only\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(paste(agency_name, title_description, sep=\" | \"), total_n_fte), y = total_n_fte)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency | Job Title\",\n    y = \"Number of Positions\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 20 Full Time Personnel Counts, by Agency and Title \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nThe total potential savings from this proposed policy amount to $15,025,441,508 (Table 5). The commission notes that the potential savings from this policy are almost 400x that of Policy I.\nEnacting this policy entails recruiting:\n\nover 30,000 police officers,\nover 20,000 firefighters,\nand over 15,000 corrections officers.\n\nThese positions are difficult to fill, as they are high-risk in nature and require specialized training. Therefore, the Commission recommends a more feasible, scaled-down version of this policy. Under this modified approach, the City would subsidize the training costs for these critical positions, and the recruitment rate would be regularly assessed to ensure that sufficient progress is being made in filling these roles.\nTable 5 presents total savings by agency.\n\nTable 5: Total Savings by Agency\n\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = base_rate_hr * ot_hours) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings, na.rm=TRUE),0)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Savings ($)\" = total_savings) |&gt;\n  datatable(options = list(pageLength = N_ITEMS,\n                           autoWidth = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  formatCurrency(columns = \"Savings ($)\", currency = \"\", digits = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Policy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\nThe third policy the Commission proposes to reduce personnel spending is the reduction of salary increases for the top 10% of earners in their respective agencies to 1.05% of their base hourly rate. The Commission found that on average, high earners get a raise every 1.85 years, and presents the distribution of the frequency of raises per year in figure 4.\n\nCode\nhigh_earners &lt;- \n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(high_earner_threshold = quantile(total_pay, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;  \n  ungroup() |&gt;  \n  filter(!is.na(total_pay),\n         !is.na(first_name),\n         !is.na(last_name),\n         !is.na(base_rate_hr),\n         !is.na(fiscal_year),\n         total_pay &gt; high_earner_threshold)\n\nhigh_earners_with_raises &lt;- \n  high_earners |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, first_name, mid_init, last_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    base_rate_change = case_when( is.na(lag(base_rate_hr)) | is.na(lag(fiscal_year)) ~ 0,\n                                  TRUE ~ (base_rate_hr - lag(base_rate_hr))/(fiscal_year - lag(fiscal_year))),\n    years_worked = max(fiscal_year,na.rm=TRUE) - min(fiscal_year,na.rm=TRUE), \n    n_raises = sum(base_rate_change &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE),\n    raises_per_year = n_raises / years_worked,\n    avg_rate_increase_per_person = mean(base_rate_change, na.rm=TRUE),\n    capped_raise = PAY_RAISE_CAP * lag(base_rate_hr, order_by = fiscal_year),  \n    excess_raise = pmax(base_rate_change - capped_raise, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(n_raises),years_worked&gt;0) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\nhigh_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(raises_per_year &lt;= 1) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = raises_per_year)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Raises per Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Employees\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of Pay Raise Frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\nWe determine the agencies and titles with the highest average number of raises per year, and find 523 high-salary jobs with an average pay raise rate of once a year.\n\n\nCode\navg_pay_raise_rate_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(raises_per_year &gt; 0 , raises_per_year &lt;= 1 ) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_pay_raise_rate = mean(raises_per_year, na.rm=TRUE),\n            med_pay_raise_rate = median(raises_per_year, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n_raises_per_agency = sum(n_raises,na.rm=TRUE),\n            .groups=\"drop\")\n\n\nWe find the average amount that the hourly base rate increases per agency. The highest average increase is $7.70 at Brooklyn Community Board 12. The Commission also notes the appearance of 11 community boards within the top 20 agencies (Figure 5).\n\nCode\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt; \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_rate_increase_per_person != Inf, avg_rate_increase_per_person != -Inf ) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_rate_increase_per_agency = mean(avg_rate_increase_per_person, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data |&gt;\n  slice_max(avg_rate_increase_per_agency, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, avg_rate_increase_per_agency), y = avg_rate_increase_per_agency)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Mean Pay Raise Amount ($/hr)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Top 20 Average Increases in Hourly Rate, by Agency\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay raise amount per agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nCombining these two metrics, we get an estimate of the amount spent per agency on high-earner raises over the last 10 fiscal years. The Department of Education far outranks all other agencies with an expenditure of almost $500 million (Figure 6). They are followed by the Police Department at just over $200 million. Over the last 10 years, the total amount spent by the City on pay raises for high earners was about $1.9 billion.\n\nCode\ntotal_raise_spending &lt;- \n  avg_pay_raise_rate_data |&gt; \n  inner_join(avg_rate_increase_per_agency_data, join_by(agency_name == agency_name)) |&gt;  \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_raise_spend_per_year = sum(n_raises_per_agency * avg_pay_raise_rate * avg_rate_increase_per_agency * 2000, na.rm=TRUE)) \n  \ntotal_raise_spending |&gt;\n  mutate(in_millions = total_raise_spend_per_year/(10^6))|&gt;\n  slice_max(in_millions,n=20) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, in_millions), y = in_millions)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Dollars (in millions)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top 20 Agencies Spending the Most on Raises for High-Earners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nThe Commission estimates that, if high-earner raises had been capped at 0.05% in 2014, total savings by the City are approximately $976 million. Such a policy could have slashed 10-year-expenditure by up to 50%. The following analysis demonstrates the potential savings:\n\n\nCode\nsavings_from_capping &lt;- \n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt; 1, base_rate_change &gt; 0, excess_raise &gt; 0, excess_raise != Inf) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n    total_savings = sum(excess_raise * FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, na.rm=TRUE),  # Assume full-time work hours\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(total_savings, n=1)\n\n\nBased on these findings, the Commission recommends adopting a measured approach to this policy. High earners should be permitted to receive higher compensation if it is justified by demonstrable productivity improvements. This ensures that wage growth is tied to measurable value.\n\n\n6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Commission’s report highlights the potential benefits of the implementation of three policies: capping salaries at the mayoral level, increasing staffing to reduce overtime, and reducing salary increases for top earners. Given the fiscal challenges facing New York City, and the Commission’s analysis of New York City’s personnel expenditure data, we most strongly support the adoption of Policy III. This option offers reasonable savings and is easy to implement."
