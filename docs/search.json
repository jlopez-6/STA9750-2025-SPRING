The Commission proposes 3 policy options:\n\nPolicy I: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level\nPolicy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nPolicy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\n\nThe data suggest that Policy II offers the largest amount of savings, although its implementation will be significantly difficult. Policy I would result in the least savings, but is the easiest to implement. Policy III strikes a balance between the two, offering moderate savings and ease of implementation.\nThe Commission most strongly recommends that the City implement Policy III, where raises for high earners are tied to demonstrated productivity improvements, ensuring sustainable wage growth.\n\n1.1.1 Quick Facts\n\nThe job title with the highest base rate of pay is Chairman with a rate of $567 per hour.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nnyc_payroll &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mp01/nyc_payroll_export.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(agency_name = str_to_title(agency_name),\n         last_name = str_to_title(last_name),\n         first_name = str_to_title(first_name),\n         work_location_borough = str_to_title(work_location_borough),\n         title_description = str_to_title(title_description),\n         leave_status_as_of_june_30 = str_to_title(leave_status_as_of_june_30))\n\n# Constants\nWORK_HOURS_IN_DAY = 7.5\nFT_ANNUAL_HOURS = 2000\nN_ITEMS = 20\nPAY_RAISE_CAP = 0.005\n\nHOURLY_RATE_MAX = nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  filter(pay_basis == \"per Hour\") |&gt;\n  arrange(base_salary) |&gt;\n  mutate(jump = base_salary - lag(base_salary)) |&gt;\n  select(jump, base_salary, agency_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(jump) |&gt;\n  slice_max(jump,n=1) |&gt;\n  pull(base_salary)\n\n# Adding total_pay and base_rt_hr columns.\nnyc_payroll &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  mutate(total_pay =\n           case_when(\n             (pay_basis == \"per Day\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &lt; 0) ~ base_salary * floor(regular_hours / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Day\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &gt;= 0) ~ base_salary * floor(regular_hours / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) + ((base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) * ot_hours * 1.5),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &gt;= 0) ~ base_salary * (regular_hours + ot_hours * 1.5),\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &gt;= 0 & ot_hours &lt; 0) ~ base_salary * regular_hours,\n             (pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & regular_hours &lt; 0) ~ NA,\n             .default = base_salary + (base_salary/FT_ANNUAL_HOURS * 1.5 * ot_hours),\n             ),\n         base_rate_hr = case_when(\n           pay_basis == \"per Day\" & (base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) &lt; HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY,\n           pay_basis == \"per Day\" & (base_salary/WORK_HOURS_IN_DAY) &gt;= HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, # I assume they meant pay basis is per Annum\n           pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & base_salary &lt; HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary,\n           pay_basis == \"per Hour\" & base_salary &gt;= HOURLY_RATE_MAX ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, # I assume they meant per Annum\n           TRUE ~ base_salary / FT_ANNUAL_HOURS\n      )\n    )\n\nhighest_base_rate &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year,\n         last_name,mid_init,first_name,\n         title_description,\n         agency_name,\n         base_rate_hr) |&gt;\n  slice_max(base_rate_hr, n=1)\n\n\n\nThe individual with the single highest city total payroll was Chief Fire Marshal at the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), Daniel E.

However, in 2025, the city government estimates that it will see an 3.8% increase in personnel spending. Likewise, the City predicts that 2026 will see a 2.6% rise in salaries, even though total expenditures will be down 1.1% that year. Indeed, rising personnel costs is and will continue to be a pervasive problem for New York City, with the Comptroller estimating a 3.4% annual growth in payroll expenditure for 2026 and beyond (Figure 1) (Comptroller, 2024).\n\nCode\nlast_yr = tail(actual_payroll,n=1) |&gt; pull(fiscal_year)\nlast_ap = tail(actual_payroll,n=1) |&gt; pull(aggregate_pay)\n\npredicted_payroll &lt;- tibble(\n  fiscal_year = c(last_yr,2025, 2026, 2027, 2028),  \n  aggregate_pay = c(last_ap,last_ap*1.038, last_ap*1.038*1.026, last_ap*1.038*1.026*1.038, last_ap*1.038*1.026*(1.038^2)) \n)\n\ncombined_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  predicted_payroll |&gt; mutate(type = \"Predicted\"),\n  actual_payroll |&gt; mutate(type = \"Actual\")\n)|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fiscal_year, y = aggregate_pay, color = type, linetype = type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +  \n  geom_point(size = 3) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Actual\" = \"#78c2ad\", \"Predicted\" = \"gray80\")) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"NYC Payroll Expenditure\",\n    x = \"Fiscal Year\",\n    y = \"Aggregate Payroll ($)\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Payroll Expenditure per Year\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nTo address this problem, Mayor Eric L.

The Commission notes that superficial changes were made to several text columns in the dataframe to prepare them for presentation. Furthermore, the Commission creates two new columns:\n\ntotal_pay\nbase_rate_hr\n\nThe total_pay column contains the total gross pay of each employee based on their base pay, their pay basis (per Hour, per Day, or assumed annual salary), and the number of hours–both regular and OT–reported. Several cases in the data set contained negative counts for hours. The Commision addressed this by setting total_pay to NA for these cases. The base_rate_hr column represents an employee’s estimated hourly wage, calculated based on their pay basis, while ensuring reasonable hourly rate assumptions of less than $67,440 per hour. This assumption was developed to address pay basis and base salary mismatch errors."

    "text": "1.5 Policy Analysis\nThe Commission proposes the following policies to address mounting payroll expenditures.\n\n1.5.1 Policy I: Capping Salaries at Mayoral Level\nOne approach to reducing personnel expenditures is to cap the salaries of subordinate employees, so that the mayor of the City earns the highest salary. Table 2 presents the salaries of New York City’s Mayor from 2014 to 2024.\n\nTable 2: Salaries of New York City’s Mayor (2014-2024)\n\n\nCode\nmayor_pay &lt;- nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(title_description == \"Mayor\" &\n           leave_status_as_of_june_30 == \"Active\") |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year, mayoral_cap = total_pay)\n\nkable(mayor_pay, col.names = c(\"Fiscal Year\", \"Mayoral Cap ($)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\nMayoral Cap ($)\n\n\n\n\n2024\n258750\n\n\n2023\n258750\n\n\n2022\n258750\n\n\n2021\n258750\n\n\n2020\n258750\n\n\n2019\n258750\n\n\n2018\n258750\n\n\n2017\n225000\n\n\n2016\n225000\n\n\n2015\n225000\n\n\n2014\n225000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, 1,566 job titles earned more money than the mayor did during the the same fiscal year. A distribution of the agencies with employees exceeding the mayoral salary is shown in figure 2. The vast majority of people who earned more money than the mayor work for the Department of Corrections. This is followed by the FDNY and the NYPD. These agencies would see the largest savings if personnel salaries are capped at the mayoral level.\n\nCode\nexceeding_agencies &lt;- nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  filter(total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  select(fiscal_year, last_name, mid_init, first_name, agency_name, title_description, total_pay) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n())\n\nremaining_agency_count &lt;- max(nrow(exceeding_agencies) - N_ITEMS, 0)\n\nremaining_sum &lt;- exceeding_agencies |&gt; \n  slice_min(n, n = remaining_agency_count) |&gt; \n  summarize(sum_n = sum(n)) |&gt; \n  pull(sum_n)\n\nremaining_agency_count\n\n\nCode\nremaining_sum\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exceeding_agencies |&gt; slice_max(n, n=N_ITEMS), aes(x = reorder(agency_name, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies Exceeding Mayoral Cap\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Number of Entries Exceeding Cap \\n(FY2014-FY2024)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of Employees in Agencies Exceeding Mayoral Cap\n\n\n[1] 47\n\n\n[1] 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nThe Commission identifies agency title groupings that have significant numbers of payroll entries over the mayoral cap. These are presented in table 3. The top two rows suggest that Captains at the Department of Corrections and the Fire Department would be most affected by this policy.\n\nTable 3: Agency-Title Pairs Exceeding Mayoral Cap\n\n\nCode\nagency_titles_over_mayoral_cap &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(is_over_cap = total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n(), n_over = sum(is_over_cap, na.rm = TRUE), freq = mean(is_over_cap, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nagency_titles_over_mayoral_cap |&gt;\n  filter(n_over &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  select(agency_name,title_description,n_over) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n_over)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Title Description\" = title_description,\n         \"Entries Over Mayoral Cap\" = n_over) |&gt;\n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total savings per fiscal year that could have resulted from enactment of the proposed policy are presented in table 4. The Commission notes that, had the proposed policy been enacted in 2014, New York City would have seen total savings of $39,074,243.\n\nTable 4: Savings per Annum from Policy I\n\n\nCode\n# Determine total savings if these employees’ compensation were capped at the mayor’s salary.\nsavings_per_year &lt;-\n  nyc_payroll |&gt; \n  left_join(mayor_pay, join_by(fiscal_year == fiscal_year)) |&gt;\n  filter(total_pay &gt; mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = total_pay - mayoral_cap) |&gt;\n  group_by(fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings,na.rm=TRUE),0), n_over = n())\n\ntotal_savings &lt;- savings_per_year |&gt; summarize(sum(total_savings, na.rm=TRUE))\n\ndatatable(savings_per_year |&gt;\n            rename(\"Fiscal Year\" = fiscal_year,\n                   \"# of Entries Exceeding Mayoral Cap\" = n_over,\n                   \"Savings ($)\" = total_savings))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission does not recommend a blanket capping subordinate salaries at the mayoral level. A majority of employees earning more than the mayor hold positions that involve significant risks. Given the nature of these high-risk jobs, the Commission believes that these employees should be fairly compensated for the additional responsibilities and dangers they face in their roles. However, the Commission is not against capping salaries on a title-by-title basis.\n\n\n1.5.2 Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nA second approach to curtailing personnel expenditure is increasing staffing to reduce OT expenses. For this analysis, the Commission assumes that a full-time position is 2000 hours a year. Figure 3 presents OT hours converted to the number of new full-time employees required to fulfill the same amount of work hours. The total number of new employees needed to address the current OT load is 200,412. This represents the workforce that would need to be hired if OT hours were eliminated through additional staffing. The Commission notes that this number is approximately 50% of the last fiscal year’s workforce 1.\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_ot = sum(ot_hours), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(n_fte_yearly = total_ot / 2000) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_n_fte = sum(n_fte_yearly, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_n_fte)) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_n_fte, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  # Show top 20 only\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(paste(agency_name, title_description, sep=\" | \"), total_n_fte), y = total_n_fte)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"OT Hours Converted to FTE\",\n    x = \"Agency | Job Title\",\n    y = \"Number of Full-Time Equivalent Positions\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Full Time Personnel Equivalent, by Agency and Title \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nThe total potential savings from this proposed policy amount to $15,025,441,508 (Table 5). The commission notes that the potential savings from this policy are almost 400x that of Policy I.\nEnacting this policy entails recruiting:\n\nover 30,000 police officers,\nover 20,000 firefighters,\nand over 15,000 corrections officers.\n\nThese positions are difficult to fill, as they are high-risk in nature and require specialized training. Therefore, the Commission recommends a more feasible, scaled-down version of this policy. Under this modified approach, the City would subsidize the training costs for these critical positions, and the recruitment rate would be regularly assessed to ensure that sufficient progress is being made in filling these roles.\nTable 5 presents total savings by agency.\n\nTable 5: Total Savings by Agency\n\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = base_rate_hr * ot_hours) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings, na.rm=TRUE),0)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Total Savings ($)\" = total_savings) |&gt;\n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Policy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\nThe third policy the Commission proposes to reduce personnel spending is the reduction of salary increases for the top 10% of earners in their respective agencies to 1.05% of their base hourly rate.

The highest average increase is $7.70 at Brooklyn Community Board 12. The Commission also notes the appearance of 11 community boards within the top 20 agencies (Figure 5).\n\nCode\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt; \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_rate_increase_per_person != Inf, avg_rate_increase_per_person != -Inf ) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_rate_increase_per_agency = mean(avg_rate_increase_per_person, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data |&gt;\n  slice_max(avg_rate_increase_per_agency, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, avg_rate_increase_per_agency), y = avg_rate_increase_per_agency)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies by Mean Pay Raise Amount\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Mean Pay Raise Amount ($/hr)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Increase in Hourly Rate per Agency\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay raise amount per agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nCombining these two metrics, we get an estimate of the amount spent per agency on high-earner raises over the last 10 fiscal years. The Department of Education far outranks all other agencies with an expenditure of almost $500 million (Figure 6). They are followed by the Police Department at just over $200 million. Over the last 10 years, the total amount spent by the City on pay raises for high earners was about $1.9 billion.\n\nCode\ntotal_raise_spending &lt;- \n  avg_pay_raise_rate_data |&gt; \n  inner_join(avg_rate_increase_per_agency_data, join_by(agency_name == agency_name)) |&gt;  \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_raise_spend_per_year = sum(n_raises_per_agency * avg_pay_raise_rate * avg_rate_increase_per_agency * 2000, na.rm=TRUE)) \n  \ntotal_raise_spending |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_raise_spend_per_year,n=20) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, total_raise_spend_per_year), y = total_raise_spend_per_year)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = paste(\"Top\",N_ITEMS,\"Agencies by Amount Spent on Pay Raises for High Earners\"),\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Dollars\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Agencies Spending the Most on Raises for High-Earners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nThe Commission estimates that, if high-earner raises had been capped at 0.05% in 2014, total savings by the City are approximately $976 million. Such a policy could have slashed 10-year-expenditure by up to 50%. The following analysis demonstrates the potential savings:\n\n\nCode\nsavings_from_capping &lt;- \n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt; 1, base_rate_change &gt; 0, excess_raise &gt; 0, excess_raise != Inf) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n    total_savings = sum(excess_raise * FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, na.rm=TRUE),  # Assume full-time work hours\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(total_savings, n=1)\n\n\nBased on these findings, the Commission recommends adopting a measured approach to this policy. High earners should be permitted to receive higher compensation if it is justified by demonstrable productivity improvements. This ensures that wage growth is tied to measurable value.\n\n\n1.6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Commission’s report highlights the potential benefits of the implementation of three policies: capping salaries at the mayoral level, increasing staffing to reduce overtime, and reducing salary increases for top earners. Given the fiscal challenges facing New York City, and the Commission’s analysis of New York City’s personnel expenditure data, we most strongly support the adoption of Policy III. This option offers reasonable savings and is easy to implement."

However, the Commission is not against capping salaries on a title-by-title basis."

The Commission notes that this number is approximately 50% of the last fiscal year’s workforce 2.\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_ot = sum(ot_hours), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(n_fte_yearly = total_ot / 2000) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_n_fte = sum(n_fte_yearly, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_n_fte)) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_n_fte, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  # Show top 20 only\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(paste(agency_name, title_description, sep=\" | \"), total_n_fte), y = total_n_fte)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency | Job Title\",\n    y = \"Number of Positions\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 20 Full Time Personnel Counts, by Agency and Title \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nThe total potential savings from this proposed policy amount to $15,025,441,508 (Table 5). The commission notes that the potential savings from this policy are almost 400x that of Policy I.\nEnacting this policy entails recruiting:\n\nover 30,000 police officers,\nover 20,000 firefighters,\nand over 15,000 corrections officers.\n\nThese positions are difficult to fill, as they are high-risk in nature and require specialized training. Therefore, the Commission recommends a more feasible, scaled-down version of this policy. Under this modified approach, the City would subsidize the training costs for these critical positions, and the recruitment rate would be regularly assessed to ensure that sufficient progress is being made in filling these roles.\nTable 5 presents total savings by agency.\n\nTable 5: Total Savings by Agency\n\n\nCode\nnyc_payroll |&gt;\n  filter(ot_hours &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(savings = base_rate_hr * ot_hours) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_savings = round(sum(savings, na.rm=TRUE),0)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt;\n  rename(\"Agency Name\" = agency_name,\n         \"Savings ($)\" = total_savings) |&gt;\n  datatable(options = list(pageLength = N_ITEMS,\n                           autoWidth = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  formatCurrency(columns = \"Savings ($)\", currency = \"\", digits = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Policy III: Reduce Salary Increases for Top Earners\nThe third policy the Commission proposes to reduce personnel spending is the reduction of salary increases for the top 10% of earners in their respective agencies to 1.05% of their base hourly rate. The Commission found that on average, high earners get a raise every 1.85 years, and presents the distribution of the frequency of raises per year in figure 4.\n\nCode\nhigh_earners &lt;- \n  nyc_payroll |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(high_earner_threshold = quantile(total_pay, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;  \n  ungroup() |&gt;  \n  filter(!is.na(total_pay),\n         !is.na(first_name),\n         !is.na(last_name),\n         !is.na(base_rate_hr),\n         !is.na(fiscal_year),\n         total_pay &gt; high_earner_threshold)\n\nhigh_earners_with_raises &lt;- \n  high_earners |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description, first_name, mid_init, last_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    base_rate_change = case_when( is.na(lag(base_rate_hr)) | is.na(lag(fiscal_year)) ~ 0,\n                                  TRUE ~ (base_rate_hr - lag(base_rate_hr))/(fiscal_year - lag(fiscal_year))),\n    years_worked = max(fiscal_year,na.rm=TRUE) - min(fiscal_year,na.rm=TRUE), \n    n_raises = sum(base_rate_change &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE),\n    raises_per_year = n_raises / years_worked,\n    avg_rate_increase_per_person = mean(base_rate_change, na.rm=TRUE),\n    capped_raise = PAY_RAISE_CAP * lag(base_rate_hr, order_by = fiscal_year),  \n    excess_raise = pmax(base_rate_change - capped_raise, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(n_raises),years_worked&gt;0) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\nhigh_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(raises_per_year &lt;= 1) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = raises_per_year)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Raises per Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Employees\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of Pay Raise Frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\nWe determine the agencies and titles with the highest average number of raises per year, and find 523 high-salary jobs with an average pay raise rate of once a year.\n\n\nCode\navg_pay_raise_rate_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(raises_per_year &gt; 0 , raises_per_year &lt;= 1 ) |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_pay_raise_rate = mean(raises_per_year, na.rm=TRUE),\n            med_pay_raise_rate = median(raises_per_year, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n_raises_per_agency = sum(n_raises,na.rm=TRUE),\n            .groups=\"drop\")\n\n\nWe find the average amount that the hourly base rate increases per agency. The highest average increase is $7.70 at Brooklyn Community Board 12. The Commission also notes the appearance of 11 community boards within the top 20 agencies (Figure 5).\n\nCode\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data &lt;-\n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt; \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_rate_increase_per_person != Inf, avg_rate_increase_per_person != -Inf ) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_rate_increase_per_agency = mean(avg_rate_increase_per_person, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_rate_increase_per_agency_data |&gt;\n  slice_max(avg_rate_increase_per_agency, n = N_ITEMS) |&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, avg_rate_increase_per_agency), y = avg_rate_increase_per_agency)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Mean Pay Raise Amount ($/hr)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Top 20 Average Increases in Hourly Rate, by Agency\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage pay raise amount per agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nCombining these two metrics, we get an estimate of the amount spent per agency on high-earner raises over the last 10 fiscal years. The Department of Education far outranks all other agencies with an expenditure of almost $500 million (Figure 6). They are followed by the Police Department at just over $200 million. Over the last 10 years, the total amount spent by the City on pay raises for high earners was about $1.9 billion.\n\nCode\ntotal_raise_spending &lt;- \n  avg_pay_raise_rate_data |&gt; \n  inner_join(avg_rate_increase_per_agency_data, join_by(agency_name == agency_name)) |&gt;  \n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_raise_spend_per_year = sum(n_raises_per_agency * avg_pay_raise_rate * avg_rate_increase_per_agency * 2000, na.rm=TRUE)) \n  \ntotal_raise_spending |&gt;\n  mutate(in_millions = total_raise_spend_per_year/(10^6))|&gt;\n  slice_max(in_millions,n=20) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(agency_name, in_millions), y = in_millions)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Agency\",\n    y = \"Dollars (in millions)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top 20 Agencies Spending the Most on Raises for High-Earners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nThe Commission estimates that, if high-earner raises had been capped at 0.05% in 2014, total savings by the City are approximately $976 million. Such a policy could have slashed 10-year-expenditure by up to 50%. The following analysis demonstrates the potential savings:\n\n\nCode\nsavings_from_capping &lt;- \n  high_earners_with_raises |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt; 1, base_rate_change &gt; 0, excess_raise &gt; 0, excess_raise != Inf) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n    total_savings = sum(excess_raise * FT_ANNUAL_HOURS, na.rm=TRUE),  # Assume full-time work hours\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_savings)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(total_savings, n=1)\n\n\nBased on these findings, the Commission recommends adopting a measured approach to this policy. High earners should be permitted to receive higher compensation if it is justified by demonstrable productivity improvements. This ensures that wage growth is tied to measurable value.\n\n\n6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Commission’s report highlights the potential benefits of the implementation of three policies: capping salaries at the mayoral level, increasing staffing to reduce overtime, and reducing salary increases for top earners. Given the fiscal challenges facing New York City, and the Commission’s analysis of New York City’s personnel expenditure data, we most strongly support the adoption of Policy III. This option offers reasonable savings and is easy to implement."

On March 1, 2025, GTA IV presented awards at the annual Greenies in New York City. “These awards highlight the incredible efforts of transit agencies committed to sustainability,” said Jocely Lopez Luna, Executive Director of GTA IV, in her opening statement at the Noli Timere theater. Small-, medium-, and large-sized transit agencies were awarded for their excellence in three categories:\nWhile the Greenies celebrate sustainability leaders, GTA IV also holds accountable those agencies that fall short. This year, the organization introduced the Noxious rating. Before handing out the ratings, Lopez Luna expressed a plucky, “hope that [these transit agencies] will reflect on and lessen the environmental impact of [their] operations.”"

The median value of offset emissions for small-sized agencies was \\(327,703\\) kg.\n\nMedium-sized Transit Agency:\n\nHudson Transit Lines, Inc., dba: Short Line from Mahwah, New Jersey, which offset \\(16,147,490\\) kg of \\(\\text{CO}_2\\). For comparison, the median value of offset emissions for a medium-sized agency was \\(974,179\\) kg.\n\nLarge-sized Transit Agency:\n\nMTA New York City Transit from Brooklyn, New York which offset a whopping \\(1,662,602,856\\) kg of \\(\\text{CO}_2\\)–almost 300 times the median offset emissions for a large-sized agency (\\(6,102,619\\) kg).\n\n\nAnalysts at GTA IV determined the total emissions avoided by first calculating the number of gallons of gasoline required for the newest model car to travel the same distance as each transit agency. This figure was then multiplied by the average emissions rate of motor gasoline, as defined by U.S. CAFE standards ((NHTSA), 2022).\n“People may be getting burned alive on our subways, but at least we’re stopping our riders from burning all that carbon,” said Don Vitiatus, CEO of the MTA, following Jay-Z’s heartfelt rendition of Empire State of Mind."

To compare, the median factor of difference for small-sized agencies was \\(5,670\\).\n\nMedium-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCity of Seattle, dba: Seattle Center Monorail from Seattle, Washington, with a factor of \\(54,628\\) difference between their EPC and their state’s electricity EPC–almost 3 times the median factor of difference for medium sized-agencies (\\(19,700\\)).\n\nLarge-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCity of Portland, dba: Portland Streetcar from Portland, Oregon, whose state’s EPC is \\(18,650\\) times larger than their own. Among large-sized agencies, the median factor of difference was about \\(12,700\\).\n\n\nThis metric compares state emissions per capita with agency emissions per capita. Agencies with the largest metrics are awarded for outstanding performance compared to their state. “We will continue to take West Virginians home down country roads in a green way, and we hope our Mountain Mama will follow our lead,” said a representative from the Ohio Valley Regional Transportation Authority. While some transit agencies set the gold standard for sustainability, others lean heavily on high-emission fuels."

A harmless yet pungent gas was released on stage, allowing awardees to experience their contribution to air pollution firsthand. “What is that smell?!” shouted a representative from Nassau Inter County Express between gags. Meanwhile, Chief Legal Officer Sue Salot from Albany Transit System threatened GTA IV with litigation.\nGTA IV announced their intention to continue funding grants for transit agencies committed to reducing their environmental impact. “We implore all of you to look deep within your operations and find ways to minimize your footprint. The world we inherit also belongs to those who come after us,” stated Lopez Luna before dropping her microphone."

To compare, the median factor of difference for small-sized agencies was \\(5,670\\).\n\nMedium-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCity of Seattle, dba: Seattle Center Monorail from Seattle, Washington, with a factor of \\(54,628\\) difference between their EPC and their state’s electricity EPC–almost 3 times the median factor of difference for medium sized-agencies (\\(19,700\\)).\n\nLarge-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCity of Portland, dba: Portland Streetcar from Portland, Oregon, whose state’s EPC is \\(18,650\\) times larger than their own. Among large-sized agencies, the median factor of difference was about \\(12,700\\).\n\n\nThis metric compares state emissions per capita with agency emissions per capita. Agencies with the largest metrics are awarded for outstanding performance compared to their state. “We will continue to take West Virginians home down country roads in a green way, and we hope our Mountain Mama will follow our lead,” said a representative from the Ohio Valley Regional Transportation Authority."

    "text": "Noxious Ratings\nWhile some transit agencies set the gold standard for sustainability, others rely heavily on high-emission fuels. Natural gas, with average \\(\\text{CO}_2\\) emissions of approximately \\(410,000\\) kg per gallon, is by far the most polluting transportation fuel. Therefore, GTA IV handed out Noxious ratings to the three agencies with the highest percentage of their total emissions coming from natural gas.\n\nSmall-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCity of Albany, dba: Albany Transit System from Albany, Georgia, with \\(99.99999\\%\\) of their total emissions being derived from natural gas. For comparison, the average small-sized transit agency derives \\(11.1\\%\\) of its emissions from natural gas.\n\nMedium-sized Transit Agency:\n\nBirmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority from Birmingham, Alabama with \\(99.99993\\%\\) of their total emissions coming from natural gas. The typical medium-sized transit agency gets \\(18.6\\%\\) of its emissions from natural gas.\n\nLarge-sized Transit Agency:\n\nCounty of Nassau, dba: Nassau Inter County Express from Mineola, New York, with \\(99.99984\\%\\) of total emissions from natural gas–far exceeding the large-agency average of \\(28.7\\%\\).\n\n\nTo help recipients of the Noxious rating truly understand the impact of natural gas on the environment, GTA IV staged an unforgettable closing ceremony. A harmless yet pungent gas was released on stage, allowing awardees to experience their contribution to air pollution firsthand. “What is that smell?!” gasped a Nassau Inter County Express representative between coughs, while Albany Transit System’s Chief Legal Officer, Sue Salot, wasted no time in threatening legal action against GTA IV.\nAfter the olfactory assault, GTA IV announced their intention to continue funding grants for transit agencies committed to reducing their environmental impact. “We implore all of you to look deep within your operations and find ways to minimize your footprint. The world we inherit also belongs to those who come after us,” stated Lopez Luna. Agencies wishing to apply for next year’s awards can do so at www.gtaiv.org/apply. Applications open on July 11, 2025, and the alliance encourages all transit agencies to participate. Lopez Luna punctuated the night with a decisive mic drop.\nGTA IV is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving sustainability in America’s transit agencies. Established in 1997, it provides grants, education, and resources to transit agency leaders to help reduce their environmental impact and pave the way for a greener future.\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\nMargaret Cortona\nGreen Transit Alliance for Investigation of Variance (GTA IV)\nPhone: 212-000-0000\nEmail: mcortona@gtaiv.org"

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThis playlist is a nod to the range of sentimentality that only the 80s could deliver–a time when synthesizers carried both dreams and dread. The opening song, “Forever Young” by Alphaville, sets a somber mood, with lead singer Marian Gold reflecting on the looming threat of nuclear annihilation haunting his generation, “Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst / Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?” This existential dread gives way to something more personal in a-ha’s “The Blue Sky,” where we find ourselves at a coffee shop mourning a lost love. A sensitive and forlorn Morten Harket laments, “It doesn’t seem like this / Blue sky’s here for me.”\nThe mood slightly lightens with “Saved By Zero” by The Fixx, a track that hides existential angst beneath hypnotic, looping guitars. R.E.M.’s “Stand,” with a funky guitar and playful melody, it plucks us out of the melodrama and onto a sun-drenched beach where Michael Stipe assures us that “Your feet are going to be on the ground / Your head is there to move you around.”\nTinges of melancholy return in “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs. Richard Butler challenges the “old way” with a defiant, “I follow where my mind goes,” but there’s a naïveté to it, like a kid announcing he’s running away from home. Meanwhile, Yazoo’s “Situation” shifts gears into full dancefloor mode. It’s a takedown of a manipulative presence, but the confrontational message gets a bit lost in the pulsing synths of the club.\nThe mood darkens with George Thorogood & The Destroyers’ “I Drink Alone.” It’s edgy and bluesy, a defiant anthem of solitude that doubles as a cry for help. Thorogood delivers each line with such raspy conviction you can practically smell the whiskey on his breath. We continue our descent into the gloom with Twisted Sister’s “The Price,” a quintessential 80s power ballad lamenting the heavy cost of chasing dreams: a rare moment of vulnerability from a band better known for their rebellious swagger.\nIn keeping with the lugubriousness, Boz Scaggs’ “Look What You’ve Done to Me” is a vulnerable break up song with a heartwrenching delivery of plaintive lines like “Look what you’ve done to me / Never thought I’d fall again so easily.” In “Fast Car,” Tracy Chapman brightens the mood with a sweet, hopeful melody, which starkly contrasts with the darker undertones of the protagonist’s story, as she swings from the chaos of an alcoholic father to the same struggles with her alcoholic husband. The Car’s “Heartbeat City” transports us to a dreamy electronic soundscape of a city with glittering lights pulsing with the rhythm of the beat.\nThe playlist wraps up with Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam’s “Lost In Emotion.” It’s a delightfully smooth landing—confident, tender, hopeful, and exactly the kind of elation we’ve been circling toward all along.\nClick play to start an emotionally engineered ride through the 1980s!"

Specifically, I shaped the playlist so that the valence of the selected songs would follow the shape of a sine wave, and create an emotional roller-coaster for listeners to ride.\nTo implement this:\n\nI generated a cosine wave scaled between 0 and 1 to define the target valence levels for each of the 12 songs in the playlist.\nI added the anchor songs to the playlist first, placing each one in the position where its valence most closely matched the wave.\nRemaining slots were filled with songs from a filtered pool of candidates that met 4 or more compatibility heuristics (see definitions above). I also restricted the decade of the song to 1980.\nFor each remaining position, I selected a song with a valence close to the target value. I allowed for a small tolerance to ensure flexibility in the song choice and still maintain the shape of the wave.\n\nThe code for implementing this is shown below.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(7)\nplaylist_length &lt;- 12\n\n# Generate cosine wave to model valence progression\nvalence_wave &lt;- (cos(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = playlist_length)) + 1) / 2\n\n# Define valence similarity tolerance\ntolerance &lt;- 0.05\n\n# Initialize empty playlist\nplaylist &lt;- data.frame()\n\n# Combine anchor songs and ensure uniqueness\nbase_songs &lt;- bind_rows(anchor_songs) |&gt; distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# Select high-confidence candidate songs\ncandidates &lt;- combined_heuristics |&gt; \n  filter(heuristic_count &gt;= 4, decade == '1980s') |&gt;\n  distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# Create a vector of available positions\navailable_slots &lt;- 1:playlist_length\n\n# Place anchor songs into playlist by matching valence to wave\nfor (i in seq_len(nrow(base_songs))) {\n  song &lt;- base_songs[i, ]\n  if (length(available_slots) == 0) break\n  \n  diffs &lt;- abs(valence_wave[available_slots] - song$valence)\n  best_slot &lt;- available_slots[which.min(diffs)]\n  \n  playlist &lt;- bind_rows(playlist, song)\n  available_slots &lt;- setdiff(available_slots, best_slot)\n  candidates &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(track_id != song$track_id)\n}\n\n# Fill remaining slots with best valence matches from candidates\nfor (slot in available_slots) {\n  target_valence &lt;- valence_wave[slot]\n  \n  pool &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(abs(valence - target_valence) &lt;= tolerance)\n  \n  # Expand tolerance if needed\n  if (nrow(pool) == 0) {\n    message(glue::glue(\"Widening tolerance at slot {slot}\"))\n    pool &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(abs(valence - target_valence) &lt;= (tolerance * 2))\n  }\n  \n  # Select one matching song if available\n  if (nrow(pool) &gt; 0) {\n    selected &lt;- sample_n(pool, 1)\n    playlist &lt;- bind_rows(playlist, selected)\n    candidates &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(track_id != selected$track_id)\n  } else {\n    message(glue::glue(\"No song could be placed at slot {slot}\"))\n  }\n}\n\n# Add song position index\nplaylist &lt;- playlist |&gt; mutate(position = row_number())\n\n# Reshape for plotting\nplaylist_long &lt;- playlist |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = all_of(metrics), names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"value\")\n\n# Plot how each metric changes across the playlist\nggplot(playlist_long, aes(x = position, y = value, group = metric, color = metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~metric, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Evolution of Song Metrics Across Playlist\",\n    x = \"Playlist Order\", y = \"Metric Value\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nThe final result is an 80s playlist designed to, at some points, make you feel like you’re about to hit 88 mph in Doc’s Delorean, and at others, like you’re slow-dancing alone at prom under a disco ball."

The opening song, “Forever Young” by Alphaville, sets a somber mood, with lead singer Marian Gold reflecting on the looming threat of nuclear annihilation haunting his generation, “Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst / Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?” This existential dread gives way to something more personal in a-ha’s “The Blue Sky,” where we find ourselves at a coffee shop mourning a lost love. A sensitive and forlorn Morten Harket laments, “It doesn’t seem like this / Blue sky’s here for me.”\nWe pivot into something more energetic with “Whip It” by DEVO, a nonsensical but peppy call to arms for personal empowerment. “Love Plus One” by Haircut 100 delves deeper into playful absurdity, hinting at the sun-soaked tropics with bongos and xylophone-like percussion. This is followed by John Mellencamp’s “Lonely Ol’ Night,” a gritty rock ballad about seeking fleeting comfort in the face of isolation. “It’s a lonely ol’ night / Can I put my arms around you?” Mellencamp pleads. Meanwhile, INXS’s “What You Need” snaps us out of the melancholy with swagger and urgency—driven by a thumping bassline and slashes of saxophone, like a confident friend grabbing your hand and pulling you back onto the dance floor.\nThe mood darkens with George Thorogood & The Destroyers’ “I Drink Alone”—an edgy, blues-soaked anthem of solitude that doubles as a cry for help. Thorogood delivers each line with such boozy conviction, you can practically smell the whiskey on his breath. George Strait’s “I Need Someone Like Me” shifts that loneliness to a country register.\n“Music For A Found Harmonium” by Penguin Cafe Orchestra begins with a simmering tension that quickly unravels into a disarmingly playful, jig-like melody. With a flash-bang, Queen’s “Flash” brings bold, bombastic, and camp energy. “I Love You Babe” by Babyface follows with warmth and sincerity, an earnest slow jam that finally says what it means. We close on a high note with Sheena Easton’s “Strut,” a fiercely confident song that dares anyone to look away.\nClick play to start an emotionally engineered ride through the 1980s!\n\n\n\n\n\nI nominate this playlist for the internet’s best playlist because I put a lot of thought into its design. I intentionally crafted the emotional flow by ordering the songs so that their valence (a measure of musical positivity) follows a cosine wave–rising and falling in a deliberate rhythm. This approach was algorithmically driven to create an emotional arc that feels both natural and dynamic.\nThe figure below visualizes how various song characteristics evolve across the playlist."

Similarity is measured using Euclidean distance: \\[d = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}\\] where \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) are the characteristic values for the anchor and candidate songs, respectively.\nDecade match and structural similarity: Songs from the same decade and duration within \\(\\pm\\) 15 seconds of the anchor song.\n\nThe application of these heuristics is implemented in the code below.\n\n\nCode\nfname &lt;- \"data/mp03/peer_songs.csv\"\nif (!file.exists(fname)){\n# What other songs commonly appear on playlists along side these songs?\npeer_songs &lt;- data.frame()\nfor (song in anchor_songs) {\n  playlist_ids &lt;- song |&gt; pull(playlist_id) |&gt; unique() |&gt; as.vector()\n  for (pid in playlist_ids) {\n    peer_songs &lt;- bind_rows(\n      peer_songs,\n      spotify_millions_songs |&gt;\n        filter(playlist_id == pid) |&gt;\n        distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n    )\n  }\n}\n  write.csv(peer_songs |&gt; distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE), fname, row.names = FALSE)\n} else{\n  peer_songs &lt;- readr::read_csv(fname)\n}\n\n# What songs have a similar key and tempo to these songs\nfname &lt;- \"data/mp03/key_and_tempo.csv\"\nif (!file.exists(fname)){\n  key_and_tempo &lt;- data.frame()\n  for (song in anchor_songs){\n    song_key &lt;- unique(song |&gt; pull(key))\n    song_tempo &lt;- unique(song |&gt; pull(tempo))\n    key_and_tempo &lt;- \n      bind_rows(\n        key_and_tempo,\n        spotify_millions_songs |&gt;\n          mutate(\n            similar_tempo = case_when(\n              abs(tempo - unique(song |&gt; pull(tempo))) &lt;= 5 ~ TRUE,\n              TRUE ~ FALSE\n            )) |&gt;\n          filter(\n            key == song_key,\n            similar_tempo == TRUE) |&gt;\n          distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n      )\n  }\n  write.csv(key_and_tempo, fname, row.names = FALSE)\n} else{\n    key_and_tempo &lt;- readr::read_csv(fname)\n}\n\n# What songs have the same artist?\nfname &lt;- \"data/mp03/same_artist.csv\"\nif (!file.exists(fname)){\n  same_artist = data.frame()\n  for (song in anchor_songs){\n    song_artist_id &lt;- unique(song |&gt; pull(artist_id))\n    same_artist &lt;- bind_rows(\n      same_artist,\n      spotify_millions_songs |&gt;\n        filter(artist_id == song_artist_id) |&gt;\n        distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n    )\n  }\n  write.csv(same_artist, fname, row.names = FALSE)\n} else{\n    same_artist &lt;- readr::read_csv(fname)\n}\n\n# What other songs were released in the same year and have similar levels of acousticness, danceability, etc.\nfname &lt;- \"data/mp03/all_similar_songs.csv\"\nif (!file.exists(fname)){\n  all_similar_songs &lt;- data.frame()\n  \n  #' Calculate Similar Songs Based on Selected Metrics\n  #'\n  #' This function identifies songs similar to a given song by calculating the Euclidean distance between \n  #' the selected metrics (e.g., acousticness, danceability, energy, etc.) of the input song and all other songs\n  #' from the same year.

Specifically, I shaped the playlist so that the valence of the selected songs would follow the shape of a sine wave, and create an emotional roller-coaster for listeners to ride.\nTo implement this:\n\nI generated a cosine wave scaled between 0 and 1 to define the target valence levels for each of the 12 songs in the playlist.\nI added the anchor songs to the playlist first, placing each one in the position where its valence most closely matched the wave.\nRemaining slots were filled with songs from a filtered pool of candidates that met 2 or more compatibility heuristics (see definitions above). I also restricted the decade of the song to 1980.\nFor each remaining position, I selected a song with a valence close to the target value. I allowed for a small tolerance to ensure flexibility in the song choice and still maintain the shape of the wave.\n\nThe code for implementing this is shown below.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(7)\nplaylist_length &lt;- 12\n\n# Generate cosine wave to model valence progression\nvalence_wave &lt;- (cos(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = playlist_length)) + 1) / 2\n\n# Define valence similarity tolerance\ntolerance &lt;- 0.05\n\n# Initialize empty playlist\nplaylist &lt;- data.frame()\n\n# Combine anchor songs and ensure uniqueness\nbase_songs &lt;- bind_rows(anchor_songs) |&gt; distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# Select high-confidence candidate songs\ncandidates &lt;- combined_heuristics |&gt; \n  filter(heuristic_count &gt;= 2, decade == '1980s') |&gt;\n  distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# Create a vector of available positions\navailable_slots &lt;- 1:playlist_length\n\n# Place anchor songs into playlist by matching valence to wave\nfor (i in seq_len(nrow(base_songs))) {\n  song &lt;- base_songs[i, ]\n  if (length(available_slots) == 0) break\n  \n  diffs &lt;- abs(valence_wave[available_slots] - song$valence)\n  best_slot &lt;- available_slots[which.min(diffs)]\n  \n  playlist &lt;- bind_rows(playlist, song)\n  available_slots &lt;- setdiff(available_slots, best_slot)\n  candidates &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(track_id != song$track_id)\n}\n\n# Fill remaining slots with best valence matches from candidates\nfor (slot in available_slots) {\n  target_valence &lt;- valence_wave[slot]\n  \n  pool &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(abs(valence - target_valence) &lt;= tolerance)\n  \n  # Expand tolerance if needed\n  if (nrow(pool) == 0) {\n    message(glue::glue(\"Widening tolerance at slot {slot}\"))\n    pool &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(abs(valence - target_valence) &lt;= (tolerance * 2))\n  }\n  \n  # Select one matching song if available\n  if (nrow(pool) &gt; 0) {\n    selected &lt;- sample_n(pool, 1)\n    playlist &lt;- bind_rows(playlist, selected)\n    candidates &lt;- candidates |&gt; filter(track_id != selected$track_id)\n  } else {\n    message(glue::glue(\"No song could be placed at slot {slot}\"))\n  }\n}\n\n# Add song position index\nplaylist &lt;- playlist |&gt; mutate(position = row_number())\n\n# Reshape for plotting\nplaylist_long &lt;- playlist |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = all_of(metrics), names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"value\")\n\n\nThe final result is an 80s playlist designed to, at some points, make you feel like you’re about to hit 88 mph in Doc’s Delorean, and at others, like you’re slow-dancing alone at prom under a disco ball."

    "text": "I nominate this playlist for the internet’s best playlist because I put a lot of thought into its design. I intentionally crafted the emotional flow by ordering the songs so that their valence (a measure of musical positivity) follows a cosine wave–rising and falling in a deliberate rhythm. This approach was algorithmically driven to create an emotional arc that feels both natural and dynamic.\nThe figure below visualizes how various song characteristics evolve across the playlist."
