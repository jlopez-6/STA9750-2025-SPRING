I’ve worked extensively with seismic data, programming, and quantitative research, and I’m currently expanding my expertise through an MS in Statistics at Baruch College.\n\nAt Lamont, I work on modernizing analog seismic data and investigating atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions. You can find my publications on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6064-1860).\n\nAs a Catholic, my faith guides my approach to learning, discovery, and service. I strive to bring truth, integrity, and purpose to everything I do.\n\nHere's my [resume](docs/cv.pdf). Explore my work, and let’s connect!\n\n--------------\nLast updated: Thursday April 24, 2025 at 10:59 AM\n\n\n",
