Hi, I’m Jocely Lopez Luna, a researcher with a B.A. in environmental science (Columbia University, '20) and 5 years of work experience in seismology at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. I’ve worked extensively with seismic data, programming, and quantitative research, and I’m currently expanding my expertise through an MS in Statistics at Baruch College.

At Lamont, I work on modernizing analog seismic data and investigating atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions. You can find my publications on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6064-1860).

As a Catholic, my faith guides my approach to learning, discovery, and service. I strive to bring truth, integrity, and purpose to everything I do.

Here's my [resume](static/cv.pdf). Explore my work, and let’s connect!
